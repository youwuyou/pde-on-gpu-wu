### Lecture 11 - 14: Final Projects

**Topic:** Hydro-mechanical solver for (in)compressible two-phase flow equations

**Repository:**  [HydroMech.jl](https://github.com/youwuyou/HydroMech.jl)

**Description:** 

The project aims to implement a collection of hydro-mechanical solvers that solve the (in)compressible two-phase flow equations in 2-/3D. As a starting point, we extend and use the existing code of the 2D incompressible solver to reproduce the porosity wave benchmark as in ([RÃ¤ss 2019](https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggz239)). The second step of the project consists of implementing the 3D version of it and to reproduce the 3D benchmark in the same paper.

After verifying the reproducibility of the developed incompressible solver, we will implement the compressible solver and reproduce the fluid injection 2D benchmark as in ([Dal Zilio 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tecto.2022.229516))
